# Maia Shell

## Overview

Maia Shell is a lightweight, modular graphical shell for Linux, built with C++ and QML. It features a unique split architecture, inspired by web technologies, separating the backend from the frontend. With Maia Shell, you can seamlessly switch between different frontend designs, such as Windows XP-inspired or GNOME-like layouts, all connected to a single, robust backend.

## Limitations

Maia Shell is an experimental proof-of-concept project. It supports basic functionality, including launching applications, managing a favorites list, session control (logout, reboot, shutdown), volume control, muting, and a functional taskbar. However, many features are not yet implemented, such as wallpaper settings, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth management. It currently supports only single-monitor setups and has been tested solely at FHD (1920x1080) resolution. This shell is ideal for enthusiasts who enjoy experimenting with early-stage software, but it is not a production-ready desktop environment.
